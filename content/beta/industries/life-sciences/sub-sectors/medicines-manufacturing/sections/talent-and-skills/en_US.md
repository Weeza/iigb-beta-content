### Pharmaceutical expertise 

The UK’s pharmaceutical services sector has well-respected expertise and an excellent track record. The pharmaceuticals sector alone now accounts for more UK-based business research and development than any other manufacturing sector. This now makes up more than 20% of all business research and development. 

All of the leading pharmaceutical corporations operating in the global market have a presence in the UK. Two of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies (GSK and AZ) also have their headquarters here. 

### Proficiency in advanced therapy medicinal products

The UK is renowned for its knowledge and resources for ataxia telangiectasia mutated products and services, such as cell and gene therapies or tissue-engineered products. 

To help your business grow, we support innovative manufacturing processes and technologies, giving you the significant skills base to deliver in this very knowledge-intensive area.

Small molecules still dominate the world’s medicines market. For new chemical entities, the UK is very competitive in ‘novel drug delivery mechanisms’, ‘tricky formulation’ and ‘continuous manufacturing’.
