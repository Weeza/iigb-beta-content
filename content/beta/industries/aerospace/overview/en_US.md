title: "An overview of the Aerospace industry in the UK"
---

With close to 3,000 companies across the UK, our aerospace sector makes a significant contribution to the UK economy. In particular, it:    
- generates over 31 billion GBP in turnover
- exports over 90% of its production directly employs over 128,000 people with 26,000 in research, design and engineering

In 2010 the UK government, in partnership with the aerospace industry, created the [Aerospace Growth Partnership](http://www.theagp.aero/). The partnership aims to:

- ensure that the UK remains the number one aerospace manufacturer in Europe
- support UK companies to broaden and diversify their customer base
- provide long-term certainty and stability to encourage industry to develop technologies for the next generation of aircraft

Through the [Aerospace Technology Institute](http://www.ati.org.uk/), the UK government is funding research and development of 3.9 billion GBP to maintain the growth of the sector. Aerospace is an industry driven by technology. Providing a long-term commitment to the level and availability of funding gives industry the certainty it needs to invest in the UK and is critical in protecting the nationâ€™s international competitiveness.
